sort1 uses: bubble
// random slow (5,714s), sorted fast(0,453s), reversed slow(4,917s)
How do you know?: processes files very slowly, but speeds up considerably when input is already sorted which bubblesort can do after iterating through data set once

sort2 uses: merge
// random fast (0.625s), sorted fast (0,383s), reversed fast(0,390s)
How do you know?: clearly fastest of the three

sort3 uses: selection
// random slow(2,160s), sorted slow(2,465s), reversed slow(2,574s)
How do you know?: processing consistently slow, which indicates that algorithm is slow and always sorts all numbers even if not needed
